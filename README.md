# About The Project
If you don't have a multimeter and need to measure a resistor, this program is for you.
My aim in doing this project is for those who are new to the field of electricity or electronics.
Having some information about what it is like before buying some tools.
I'm currently use tkinter because I'm new on oop so thats my oop test project. I'll continue with qt after that project.
